            <p><b>cutting-edge technology</b></p>
            <p> Over the last two and a half decades, our pursuit of quality has led in the establishment of over 40 locations throughout the island, including professional vehicle workshops and body shops in Kaduwela and Ingiriya. We also have over 1000 personnel who are all trained and equipped with the most up-to-date trends and procedures in the auto maintenance industry.
